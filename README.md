Installation
============
1. Download WarpDrive.jar from the [Curse website](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/warpdrive) and put it in your mods folder
2. You'll need either ComputerCraft or OpenComputer.
3. EU and RF power are supported (including but not limited to IC2, Gregtech, AdvancedSolarPanel, AtomicScience, BigReactors, EnderIO, Thermal Expansion, ImmersiveEngineering). ICBM, MFFS, Advanced Repulsion System, Advanced Solar Panels and GraviSuite are supported.


Developping
===========

To setup you development environment:
1. From the WarpDrive mod folder, type:
```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
./gradlew eclipse
```
2. Copy the WarpDrive/eclipse/mods folder to your target mods folder. Specificaly, you need the fake WarpDriveCore-dev.jar; it'll force FML to run the integrated coremod which is required to enable gravity and breathing hooks.
3. Import the code formating rules from Eclipse-nowrap.xml.
3. Start Minecraft with `GradleStart` class
